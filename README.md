# 100 Days of Code: Java Series with Solutions

Welcome to the **100 Days of Code: Java Series with Solutions** repository! This series is designed for students and professionals preparing for placement interviews, especially for practical coding rounds. The repository includes solutions to 100 programming problems provided by the **Training and Placement Cell of Darshan University, Rajkot**.

## 🚀 About the Series
This repository focuses on solving frequently asked coding problems in **Java** (and some in **C**, **C++**, and **JavaScript**), showcasing practical coding skills. These problems are meticulously curated for placement preparation, emphasizing:

- Algorithmic thinking
- Problem-solving skills
- Efficient coding practices

> **Note:** Python is not used in this series due to specific company restrictions.

## 📁 Folder Structure
Each day is organized into its respective folder:

```
Day 1
├── program1.java
├── solution.md(iteration-photo , some logics)

Day 2
├── program2.java
├── solution.md(iteration-photo , some logics)

...and so on for 100 days.
```

### Example: Day 1
- **Program:** `program1.java`
- **Solution:** Detailed explanation of the code, including edge cases and iterative improvements, in `solution.md`.
- **Illustration:** Iteration photos or diagrams to help visualize the solution process.

## 📝 Topics Covered
This series includes problems on:
- Array manipulations
- String operations
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Recursion
- Dynamic programming
- Graph algorithms
- Tree traversals
- Linked lists and their operations
- Practical scenarios like palindrome checks, Fibonacci series, and more

Each topic is crucial for clearing placement interviews, especially the practical coding rounds.

## 🎯 Why This Series is Important
- **Targeted Preparation:** Focuses on problems frequently asked in interviews.
